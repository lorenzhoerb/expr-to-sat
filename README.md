## Features

- **Boolean Expression Conversion:** Convert boolean expressions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for use in SAT solving.
- **SAT Solving:** Utilize SAT4J library to check the satisfiability of CNF formulas.
- **Variable Assignments:** Map SAT solver variable IDs back to the original variable names and print variable assignments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SAT4J library
